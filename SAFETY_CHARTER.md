# NeighbourNet Safety & Ethics Charter

## Purpose

NeighbourNet is a public-good project intended to explore local, offline communication and coordination in situations where connectivity, infrastructure, or trust may be limited.

This charter defines **non-negotiable safety, ethics, and scope boundaries** for the project.  
It exists to protect users, contributors, and maintainers — especially in early and experimental phases.

If this charter is violated, the project has failed its stated purpose.

---

## Status of the Software

NeighbourNet is **experimental software**.

At present:
- it is incomplete
- it may contain bugs or failures
- it may not behave reliably under real-world conditions

NeighbourNet **must not be relied upon as a sole safety or emergency solution**.

The software is provided **without guarantees of availability, accuracy, delivery, or response**.

---

## Non-Substitution Principle

NeighbourNet:
- is **not** a replacement for emergency services
- is **not** a medical device
- is **not** a personal safety guarantee
- is **not** a surveillance or monitoring system

Users must be encouraged to use NeighbourNet **alongside**, not instead of, other safety measures and communication methods.

---

## Vulnerable Populations

NeighbourNet acknowledges that some users may be vulnerable, including but not limited to:
- people without stable housing
- people experiencing harassment or stalking
- people in crisis or distress
- people with limited digital literacy
- people with limited access to power or connectivity

### Ethical Commitment

NeighbourNet **will not**:
- market directly to vulnerable populations
- encourage reliance by vulnerable users
- conduct testing involving vulnerable populations without appropriate safeguards and informed consent
- frame the software as protective, preventative, or guaranteed to improve personal safety

If the software proves useful to vulnerable users, that usefulness must be **discovered organically**, not promoted.

---

## Testing Ethics

Public testing is permitted only under the following conditions:

- participation is **explicitly opt-in**
- testing scenarios are **low risk**
- testing environments are **non-emergency**
- clear warnings are displayed stating the software is experimental
- participants have access to **backup communication methods**

NeighbourNet will **not** conduct live testing during real emergencies or crisis situations.

---

## Identity and Privacy Principles

NeighbourNet is designed around **minimal identity**.

The project commits to:
- no mandatory accounts
- no persistent public profiles
- no global user directory
- no real-name requirements
- no default collection of personal data

Any optional data sharing must be:
- clearly disclosed
- user-initiated
- revocable
- limited in scope and duration

---

## Location Safety

Location sharing is inherently sensitive.

NeighbourNet commits to:
- coarse location by default
- explicit user control over visibility
- time-limited location data (TTL)
- clear “hide location” and “exit” actions

Precise or persistent location tracking must **never** be required for core functionality.

---

## Harassment, Abuse, and Predatory Risk

NeighbourNet acknowledges that any communication system can be misused.

The project mitigates this risk through **design constraints**, including:
- temporary rooms and messages
- context-based interaction (no global discovery)
- easy exit from any interaction
- device-level blocking
- no unsolicited media
- no automatic voice or video connections

NeighbourNet does **not** attempt to eliminate all harmful behavior.  
Instead, it aims to **limit persistence, scale, and leverage** available to bad actors.

---

## Feature Restraint

Features that increase risk will not be added unless there is a clear, demonstrated safety benefit.

In particular, NeighbourNet will treat the following as **high-risk** and subject to extreme scrutiny:
- live voice or video
- background monitoring or relaying
- reputation or scoring systems
- public user discovery
- permanent identifiers
- automated decision-making or AI authority

Removing a feature for safety reasons is always an acceptable outcome.

---

## Authority and Third-Party Participation

Participation by authorities, organizations, or third parties is **optional** and must be:
- clearly labeled
- non-coercive
- non-exclusive

NeighbourNet does not assume the presence, competence, or trustworthiness of any authority.

No authority integration may override user agency.

---

## Transparency and Honesty

NeighbourNet commits to:
- clear disclosure of limitations
- visible safety warnings in early builds
- public documentation of major decisions
- refusal to overstate capabilities

If a feature does not work reliably, it must be described as such.

---

## Governance and Stewardship

NeighbourNet is an open-source public-good project.

- Forks are permitted.
- Official builds are stewarded to prevent impersonation or malicious redistribution.
- Decisions are documented and explained publicly.

Consensus is valued, but **safety overrides popularity**.

---

## Accountability

This charter applies to:
- maintainers
- contributors
- official releases
- public communications

If future maintainers cannot uphold this charter, stewardship should be transferred or the project paused.

---

## Final Statement

NeighbourNet exists to help people **coordinate locally without increasing harm**.

If the project ever prioritizes growth, engagement, or visibility over safety and restraint, it should be considered compromised.

Nothing in this project is more important than the people who might encounter it in moments of vulnerability.
