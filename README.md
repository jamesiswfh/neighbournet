# NeighbourNet

NeighbourNet is an **experimental, public-good project** exploring local, offline communication and coordination for situations where connectivity, trust, or infrastructure may be limited.

It is built **slowly and in public**, with safety, restraint, and honesty as core values.

⚠️ **Important**
NeighbourNet is in early development.
It must **not** be relied on for personal safety or emergencies at this stage.

---

## What NeighbourNet Is
- A local-first communication and coordination tool
- Designed to work without accounts, servers, or continuous internet
- Focused on temporary, contextual interaction
- Intended for disasters, outages, and everyday low-connectivity situations

## What NeighbourNet Is Not
- Not a replacement for emergency services
- Not a social network
- Not a tracking or surveillance system
- Not a guarantee of safety

NeighbourNet provides **tools**, not promises.

---

## Core Principles
- Offline first
- Local before global
- Temporary by default (messages and rooms expire)
- Minimal identity
- Easy exit at all times
- Authority participation is optional and clearly labeled
- Safety over features
- Restraint over growth

---

## Current Status
**Early Alpha / Design & Prototype Phase**

Currently exploring:
- Text-only local chat
- Temporary rooms tied to context
- Expiring messages
- Coarse location pins
- Local knowledge base (first aid & safety basics)

Not implemented:
- Reliable mesh networking
- Voice or video
- Gateways or hubs
- Authority integration
- AI assistance

---

## Safety & Ethics
NeighbourNet will **not** test unfinished software on vulnerable populations.

Public testing, when it happens, will be:
- opt-in
- low-risk
- clearly labeled
- supported by backup communication methods

See `SAFETY_CHARTER.md` for details.

## How You Can Help (No Coding Required)
You can contribute by:
- Reviewing safety assumptions and threat models
- Challenging features that may cause harm
- Helping write or simplify knowledge-base content
- Reviewing language for clarity and accessibility
- Suggesting ethical testing scenarios
- Helping document decisions and trade-offs

Coding help may be needed later, but is **not required** to participate now.

---

## Governance
NeighbourNet is an open-source public-good project.

- Core formats and protocols are open
- Forks are allowed
- The NeighbourNet name and official builds are stewarded to prevent misuse or impersonation

Decisions are explained publicly.
Consensus is valued, but safety takes precedence.

---

## License
To be determined.
Intent: permissive open source, consistent with public-good use.
