# NeighbourNet — Web UI Demo (Static)

This folder is a **static UI demo** (no real networking, no real data).
It exists to explore layout and interaction choices.

## How to run locally
Just open `index.html` in a browser.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Put this folder in a repo under `docs/` or the root.
2. GitHub repo → Settings → Pages
3. Source: `Deploy from a branch`
4. Branch: `main`, Folder: `/docs` (or `/root`)
5. Save → wait for Pages to publish.

## Safety
This demo is **not** a working safety tool. Do not rely on it.
